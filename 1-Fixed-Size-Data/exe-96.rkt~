; A SIGS is one of:

; -- (make-fired UFO Tank Missile)

; Answer: first instance is a stage that world state tank is aim but not fired missile
; second instance is a stage that ws is fired and missile is just at start point of tank height
; third instace is a stage that ws is fired and missile is launch out of tank
